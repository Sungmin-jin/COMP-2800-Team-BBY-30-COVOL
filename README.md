## General Information
Air Tutor is a web application for students who are not doing well with their classes in remote learning. In Air Tutor, students can request help with their homework and tutors can message these students, eventually scheduling a session where both tutors and students can use voice call and canvas features so that the tutor can better teach the material and the student can better understand it. 

The features of this project include:
* A submission feature utilized by students so they can request help for homework
* A messaging feature utilized by tutors so they can communicate their ability to help with their homework
* A scheduling feature utilized by students so they can schedule sessions with a tutor
* A voice call feature utilized by both students and tutors so that tutors can better teach the material and the student can better understand the material
* A canvas feature utilized by both students and tutors so tutors can visually communicate the material and students can show the thought process of their learning
* A live chat feature utilized by both students and tutors where students can ask quick questions about their homework and tutors can respond in real time
* A rating feature utilized by students where they can rate their tutor after a session; this rating will then be displayed in the tutorâ€™s profile page to highlight their credibility
* A Google sign in feature utilized by both students and tutors where they can easily sign in with their Google accounts 
* A social media share feature utilized by both students and tutors where they can share the link with their friends through Facebook or Twitter

## Quick Start

### Add a default.json file in config folder with the following

```
{
  "mongoURI": "<your_mongoDB_Atlas_uri_with_credentials>",
  "jwtSecret": "secret",
  "githubToken": "<yoursecrectaccesstoken>"
}
```

### Install server dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Install client dependencies

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

### Run both Express & React from root

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build for production

```bash
cd client
npm run build
```

## Deploy to Heroku

If you followed the sensible advice above and included `config/default.json` `and config/production.json` in your .gitignore file, then pushing to Heroku will omit your config files from the push.  
However, Heroku needs these files for a successful build.  
So how to get them to Heroku without commiting them to GitHub?

What I suggest you do is create a local only branch, lets call it _production_.

```bash
git checkout -b production
```

We can use this branch to deploy from, with our config files.

Add the config file...

```bash
git add -f config/production.json
```

This will track the file in git on this branch only. **DON'T PUSH THE PRODUCTION BRANCH TO GITHUB**

Commit...

```bash
git commit -m 'ready to deploy'
```

Create your Heroku project

```bash
heroku create
```

And push the local production branch to the remote heroku master branch.

```bash
git push heroku production:master
```

Now Heroku will have the config it needs to build the project.

> **Don't forget to make sure your production database is not whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas, otherwise the database connection will fail and your app will crash.**

After deployment you can delete the production branch if you like.

```bash
git checkout master
git branch -D production
```

Or you can leave it to merge and push updates from another branch.  
Make any changes you need on your master branch and merge those into your production branch.

```bash
git checkout production
git merge master
```

Once merged you can push to heroku as above and your site will rebuild and be updated.
